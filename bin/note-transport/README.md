# Miden note transport

The note transport service stores private note envelopes for recipients that poll by note tag. It is part of the Miden
node workspace and uses the workspace license.

## Run the service

Create the database before starting the service:

```sh
miden-note-transport bootstrap --data-directory ./note-transport-data
miden-note-transport start --data-directory ./note-transport-data --max-storage-bytes 1073741824
```

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:57292`. Use `--listen` to change it. Set `MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_DATA_DIRECTORY`,
`MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_LISTEN`, and `MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_MAX_STORAGE_BYTES` instead of the corresponding flags if
needed. Use `--enable-otel` to export traces. The service uses the same OpenTelemetry environment variables and log
filters as the other node binaries.

Start verifies the schema and does not create or migrate the database. Use
`migrate --data-directory ./note-transport-data` to apply pending migrations. The database file is `notes.sqlite3`
inside the required data directory. Bootstrap creates the directory if it does not exist and rejects a directory that is
not empty.

The service retains notes for 30 days by default. Set `--retention-days` or `MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` to
change this period. All size, capacity, connection, and retention limits must be greater than zero.

Each new insertion deletes at most 10 expired notes, ordered by timestamp and then cursor. Duplicate retries, reads, and
idle periods do not trigger cleanup. There is no background cleanup or manual cleanup command.

The insertion, cleanup, and final storage capacity check use one atomic transaction. Cleanup can reclaim space for the
new note. If there is still insufficient space, the transaction rolls back the insertion and all deletions. Cleanup
keeps the durable cursor counter. This retention policy requires no schema migration.

## API

The public `note_transport.Api` service is defined in the workspace protobuf crate. It supports `SendNote` and
`FetchNotes` over gRPC and gRPC-Web. Standard gRPC health and reflection are available on the same listener. There are
no note subscriptions or statistics RPCs.

`SendNote` accepts a `SendNoteRequest` whose `note` field contains a `TransportNote` with the shared protocol note
header and note details. It returns an empty `SendNoteResponse`. The service checks that the details commitment matches
the header. An optional block hint gives recipients a lower bound for their chain scan. The service stores this hint
without chain lookup; an absent hint differs from block zero.

A retry with the same note ID succeeds and keeps the first envelope, timestamp, and cursor. This also applies when the
retry supplies a different block hint or storage is full.

`FetchNotes` accepts at most 128 tags and an exclusive cursor with a `fixed64` database nonce and a `fixed64` sequence.
Omit the cursor to start from the first retained note. Store the complete response cursor and use it for the next
request with the same set of tags. Results follow insertion order across all requested tags. Duplicate tags do not
duplicate results. Every successful response includes a cursor. An initial empty page returns the current nonce and
sequence zero. Later empty pages retain the request cursor. The response `has_more` field indicates that another page is
available. Nonce zero is valid and has no special meaning.

A cursor belongs to the requested set of tags. Clear the cursor when you add or remove tags. Reordering tags or changing
duplicate tags does not change the set. Restarting a fetch from the beginning can return notes that you fetched before.
Use note IDs to remove duplicate results.

For example, after you fetch tag A through cursor 100, clear the cursor when you add tag B. If you reuse cursor 100, you
skip retained notes for tag B with cursors at or below 100.

A page contains at most 500 notes and 3 MiB of canonically serialized header and detail bytes. The encoded response also
fits the default 4 MiB gRPC client limit. The default per-note limit is 512,000 bytes. `--max-note-size` can change it
up to the page limit. The required `--max-storage-bytes` limits retained header and detail bytes. It does not include
SQLite indexes, database metadata, or WAL disk usage. Cursor sequences use the positive signed 64-bit range supported by
SQLite. Sequence zero starts a fetch. Nonces use the complete unsigned 64-bit range. Recipients must poll before notes
expire.

The service generates a random nonce when it creates the database. Schema migration initializes the nonce for existing
databases. Ordinary service restarts, repeated migrations, and retention cleanup preserve the nonce. A cursor from a
different database generation returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. Clear the cursor and fetch again after this error.
Deduplicate results by note ID. The nonce detects a generation change; it does not recover lost notes or authenticate
cursors.

The structured cursor is incompatible with the scalar cursor API. Coordinate client and server upgrades. Discard
persisted scalar cursors when upgrading clients. Run the database migration before starting the updated service.
Restoring an older backup also restores its nonce. That recovery procedure must rotate the nonce before the service
starts. This service does not provide a nonce rotation command.

Malformed requests return `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Note size and storage capacity limits return `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. Storage
failures return `INTERNAL` and are logged by the service.

## Development

```sh
cargo test -p miden-note-transport
make format
```

The database uses `miden-node-db` transaction and migration helpers. It supports SQLite only.
