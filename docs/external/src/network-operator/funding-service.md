# Funding Service

The funding service sends the chain's native asset to any account that asks for it. It owns one wallet account, which
holds the native asset, and creates a public pay-to-ID note for each request.

A transaction pays its fee in the native asset out of the vault of the account that executes it. Infrastructure that
submits transactions therefore needs a source of that asset. On a network without a public faucet the funding service is
that source, and it gives an operator a single account to keep funded.

## Provision the funding account

The funding account is created at genesis. Add a named wallet to the genesis configuration:

```toml
[[wallet]]
account_type = "public"
assets       = [{ amount = 1_000_000_000_000, symbol = "MIDEN" }]
name         = "funding_service"
```

The name is required, and `miden-validator genesis` writes the account file to
`<accounts-directory>/funding_service.mac`, so the service loads it from a fixed path. The account must be public: the
service reads the account's vault and nonce back from the node, which only stores the full state of a public account.

The amount is in base units of the native asset, which has six decimals. The example is one million MIDEN. Size it for
the lifetime of the network: on a development or test network a pre-funded balance large enough to last for years avoids
any manual top-up. Note that the total issuance of all genesis accounts must stay within the native faucet's maximum
supply.

`--tx-expiration-delta` is an upper bound, not a fixed value. A funding transaction reads the chain's fee configuration,
and the protocol lowers the expiration delta of a transaction which reads mutable state. A funding transaction therefore
expires at or before the requested block.

A funding request blocks until the note is committed, so `--http.timeout` must exceed the proving time plus the
expiration window (`--tx-expiration-delta` multiplied by the chain's block interval). Raise it where proving is slow. A
client must set a matching deadline of its own.

Every option also reads from an environment variable named `MIDEN_FUNDING_<OPTION>`, for example
`MIDEN_FUNDING_ACCOUNT_FILE`.

## API

The service serves a JSON over HTTP API on `--listen`.

| Endpoint              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /status`         | Returns the service version, the funding account's ID, its balance, the block the service is synchronized to, the configured maximum amount, and the verification base fee. |
| `POST /request-funds` | Creates a public pay-to-ID note for an account, waits for the note to commit, and returns the note with proof of its inclusion.                                             |

A funding request names the target account and the amount in base units:

```json
{ "account_id": "0x...", "amount": 1000000 }
```

The account ID is hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix. The response carries the note, the proof that the note is in a block,
and the transaction that created it. Each value is the hexadecimal encoding of the serialized object, without a prefix:

```json
{ "note": "...", "inclusion_proof": "...", "transaction_id": "..." }
```

The notes are public, so the node stores their details.

The service does not authenticate requests. Restrict access to the API with a proxy or a load balancer.

Requests that arrive while a transaction is in progress share the next transaction, up to `--max-notes-per-tx`. A client
that tops up several accounts at once therefore waits for one transaction rather than one per account.

## Health and errors

The service has no health endpoint. `GET /status` answers while the service still synchronizes, so it reports that the
process runs and does not track whether the node is reachable. A request that cannot be served fails on its own.

A failed request answers with a JSON body that holds the reason:

```json
{ "error": "the requested amount must not be zero" }
```

The status code tells a client whether to change the request, add funds, or send the request again.

| Status                      | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 Bad Request`           | The account ID is malformed, the requested amount is zero, or the amount exceeds `--max-amount`.          |
| `408 Request Timeout`       | The request ran longer than `--http.timeout`.                                                             |
| `409 Conflict`              | The funding transaction did not commit before it expired, or the node rejected it. No note was created.   |
| `412 Precondition Failed`   | The funding account cannot cover the request plus the fee of one transaction. An operator must add funds. |
| `429 Too Many Requests`     | Too many requests are queued.                                                                             |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | The service failed for a reason the client cannot act on.                                                 |
| `503 Service Unavailable`   | The node is unreachable, or the service is shutting down. The transaction may have reached the node.      |

A request that fails with 400, 409, 412, or 429 created no note, and a client may send it again as it is. Either the
service never built a transaction, or the node rejected it, or the transaction expired, and an expired transaction
cannot commit later.

A request that fails with 408, 500, or 503 may still have created the note. The service loses contact with the node
after it submits the transaction, so it cannot tell whether the node accepted the transaction. A client that sends the
request again may fund the account twice.

## Keep the account funded

`GET /status` reports the funding account's balance, which is the value to alert on.

To refill the account, send it a **public** pay-to-ID note that holds the native asset. The service scans for those
notes and consumes them on its own, so no operator action is needed beyond sending the note. The scan runs every
`--p2id-collection-interval`, which defaults to one minute.

A note is only collected when all of the following hold. Anything else is ignored, because the note tag encodes only the
leading bits of an account ID, so notes for other accounts reach the service too, and anyone can send a note that holds
whatever they like.

| Requirement                                | Why                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The note is public                         | The node does not store the details of a private note, so the service cannot consume it. |
| It is a pay-to-ID note                     | Any other script may not release its assets to the account.                              |
| It targets the funding account             | The tag alone does not prove the target.                                                 |
| It holds the native asset and nothing else | Another asset would sit in the vault without the service being able to spend it.         |

The service collects deposits in their own transaction, separate from the transactions that serve requests, so a note it
cannot consume never fails a request a client is waiting on. That transaction pays its own fee, and it works even when
the balance has reached zero, because the assets of a consumed note land before the fee is withdrawn.

A deposit already collected is never collected twice: the service checks each candidate's nullifier against the chain
before consuming it.
