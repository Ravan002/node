# Funding Service

The funding service sends the chain's native asset to any account that asks for it. It owns one wallet account, which
holds the native asset, and creates a public pay-to-ID note for each request.

A transaction pays its fee in the native asset out of the vault of the account that executes it. Infrastructure that
submits transactions therefore needs a source of that asset. On a network without a public faucet the funding service is
that source, and it gives an operator a single account to keep funded.

## Provision the funding account

The funding account is created at genesis. Add a named wallet to the genesis configuration:

```toml
[[wallet]]
account_type = "public"
assets       = [{ amount = 1_000_000_000_000, symbol = "MIDEN" }]
name         = "funding_service"
```

The name is required, and `miden-validator genesis` writes the account file to
`<accounts-directory>/funding_service.mac`, so the service loads it from a fixed path. The account must be public: the
service reads the account's vault and nonce back from the node, which only stores the full state of a public account.

The amount is in base units of the native asset, which has six decimals. The example is one million MIDEN. Size it for
the lifetime of the network: on a development or test network a pre-funded balance large enough to last for years avoids
any manual top-up. Note that the total issuance of all genesis accounts must stay within the native faucet's maximum
supply.

`--tx-expiration-delta` is an upper bound, not a fixed value. A funding transaction reads the chain's fee configuration,
and the protocol lowers the expiration delta of a transaction which reads mutable state. A funding transaction therefore
expires at or before the requested block.

A funding request is answered without a call to the node, so `--http.timeout` only has to cover the service's own work.

Every option also reads from an environment variable named `MIDEN_FUNDING_<OPTION>`, for example
`MIDEN_FUNDING_ACCOUNT_FILE`.

## API

The service serves a JSON over HTTP API on `--listen`.

| Endpoint              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /status`         | Returns the service version, the funding account's ID, its balance, the block the service is synchronized to, the configured maximum amount, and the verification base fee. |
| `POST /request-funds` | Creates a public pay-to-ID note for an account, returns it at once, and queues it for the next funding transaction.                                                         |

A funding request names the target account and the amount in base units:

```json
{ "account_id": "0x...", "amount": 1000000 }
```

The account ID is hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix. The response carries the note as the hexadecimal encoding of the
serialized object, without a prefix:

```json
{ "note": "..." }
```

The service answers **before** it submits the transaction that creates the note, so the note is not on chain yet. The
service keeps retrying until the note commits. A client that needs the note on chain either polls the node for the note
ID or consumes the note as an unauthenticated input note, which the node authenticates when it builds the block. The
notes are public, so the node stores their details once they commit.

The service does not authenticate requests. Restrict access to the API with a proxy or a load balancer.

Requests that arrive while a transaction is in progress share the next transaction, up to `--max-notes-per-tx`. A client
that tops up several accounts at once is therefore served by one transaction rather than one per account.

## Health and errors

The service has no health endpoint. `GET /status` answers while the service still synchronizes, so it reports that the
process runs and does not track whether the node is reachable. A request that cannot be served fails on its own.

A failed request answers with a JSON body that holds the reason:

```json
{ "error": "the requested amount must not be zero" }
```

The status code tells a client whether to change the request, add funds, or send the request again.

| Status                      | Meaning                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `400 Bad Request`           | The account ID is malformed, the requested amount is zero, or the amount exceeds `--max-amount`. |
| `408 Request Timeout`       | The request ran longer than `--http.timeout`.                                                    |
| `412 Precondition Failed`   | The balance the service last read does not cover the request plus the fee of one transaction.    |
| `429 Too Many Requests`     | Too many notes are queued.                                                                       |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | The service failed for a reason the client cannot act on.                                        |
| `503 Service Unavailable`   | The service is shutting down.                                                                    |

A request that fails created no note, and a client may send it again as it is. The service builds the note before it
answers, so a request that answers with 200 always names a note the service goes on to create.

The 412 check is best effort. It reads the balance of an earlier block and does not account for the notes already
queued, so a request it admits can still wait in the queue until a deposit raises the balance. Raising the balance is an
operator action, which is what the status code reports.

## Keep the account funded

`GET /status` reports the funding account's balance, which is the value to alert on.

To refill the account, send it a **public** pay-to-ID note that holds the native asset. The service scans for those
notes and consumes them on its own, so no operator action is needed beyond sending the note. The scan runs every
`--p2id-collection-interval`, which defaults to one minute. The scan starts at the genesis block after a restart, so a
deposit sent while the service was down is still found.

A note is only collected when all of the following hold. Anything else is ignored, because the note tag encodes only the
leading bits of an account ID, so notes for other accounts reach the service too, and anyone can send a note that holds
whatever they like.

| Requirement                                | Why                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The note is public                         | The node does not store the details of a private note, so the service cannot consume it. |
| It is a pay-to-ID note                     | Any other script may not release its assets to the account.                              |
| It targets the funding account             | The tag alone does not prove the target.                                                 |
| It holds the native asset and nothing else | Another asset would sit in the vault without the service being able to spend it.         |

A deposit is consumed as an input note of the next funding transaction, alongside the notes that transaction creates.
The assets of an input note land before the fee is withdrawn, so a deposit pays for the notes of the same transaction
and the collection works even when the balance has reached zero.

A deposit already spent is never consumed again: the service checks each candidate's nullifier against the chain before
it uses the note.

One transaction consumes at most 16 deposits, the largest ones first, which bounds its proving time. A transaction that
consumes deposits and creates no note is only submitted when those deposits are worth more than the fee, so a note
holding a single base unit cannot be used to make the account spend more than it gains.
